# Program Rom has 8 12-bit memory slots
# program counter value increments by 1 and stops incrementing once it value gets to 7.
# This is done by designing RCA-bit in such a way that it changes it incrementing value from 1 to 0 once the input
  value(PC value) is 7.
# program adds up  numbers 1 to 3 to the register 7 cumulatively.
